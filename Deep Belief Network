Deep Belief Network (DBN) is an extension of RBM.
DBNs are stacked RBMs layer by layer.


Learning in DBN

DBN uses pretraining before applying backpropagation.
This pretraining is similar to how RBS learn by reconstruction.
Generative weights determine how parameters in one layer depend on the parameters in the previous layer.
In the forward pass, it is the observed weight.
In the reverse pass, it is the generative weights.
This avoids the learning from getting into local minima.


Applications of DBN

Sequence Recognition in Videos
Facial Recognition
Motion capture


DBN is multi-layer belief networks. where each layer is Restricted Boltzmann Machine stacked against each other to for the Deep belief Network. The first step of training DBN is to learn a layer of features from the visible units, 
using Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm. Then, the next step is to treat the activations of previously trained features as 
visible unites and learn features of features in a second hidden layer. Finally, the whole DBN is trained when the learning for the final hidden layer is achieved
