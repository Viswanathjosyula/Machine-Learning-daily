Shallow Learning

You would have come across this term Shallow Learning. When does shallow learning happen in Neural Networks?
When you just have one hidden layer between your inputs and outputs.
Another way of interpreting that idea is, you are just performing one task at a time.

When it comes to structured data(Data Base), shallow learning models can be applied for supervised learning.

Shallow Learning - Tasks and Algorithms

Some of the tasks that can be grouped under shallow learning are:

Feature Extraction - Preprocessing
Mapping specific features into vector space - Kernel methods
Rule-based decision making - Decision Trees
Combining various estimates - Ensemble methods

===================================================================
Deep Learning

In deep learning, you have two or more hidden layers. This allows the algorithm to perform multiple tasks.
There are Multiple Stack Layers of Neurons
There are Specialized layers based on data type - Image, Text, and Voice

Deep Learning Models work well for unstructured data(Images, voice calls, videos, text)

==================================================================
Types of data and models

Voice Data -Sequence Models work well for Voice Data.
Text Data - Recurrent Neural Networks work well for Text Data. However, even a general multi layer
perceptron can be trained for text data
Word2Vec is a popular Deep Learning Representation of Text Data.
Image Data - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the best

Pattern Complexity

For simple patterns - Use methods like SVM
For Moderate patterns - Deep nets out perform
For Complex Patters - Deep nets - only practical choice
