A deep net platform is service that allows you to incorporate deep net in our applications without building one from scratch. 
This platform provides a set of tools and interface to build your own custom deep net.


Types of Deep Net Platforms

Deep net platforms are of two types.

Software platform: This platform is available as downloadable packages that need to be deployed on your hardware.
Full platform: It is available as online interactive UI to build and deploy models without any coding experience.


Platforms:

ersatz labs - Hardware(involves coding)

***********************************************************************************************
H2o.ai - software application

H2O.ai is an opensource machine learning platform. Along with many machine learning algorithms, 
this platform currently provides one deep net capability that is Multilayer Perceptron.
It offers intuitive UI and powerful data munging capabilities.
It is available as a downloadable package that has to be installed and managed in our own hardware infrastructure.

Features of H2O.ai

H2O.ai supports machine learning models as GLM, Distributed random forest, K-means clustering, gradient boosting machine, 
a Cox proportional hazard and Naive Bayes classifier.
Supports Multilayer perceptron for deep learning model which uses L-BFGS algorithm for backpropagation.
H2O.ai offers built-in integration tools for platforms like HDFS, Amazon S3, SQL, and NoSQL.
Platform's intuitive UI can be accessed by programming environments like R, Python, and JSON.
You can model and analyze data with Tableau, Microsoft excel and RStudio.
Since you need to download the package and deploy in your hardware, H2O.ai comes with in-memory map reduce, 
columnar compression to help speed the training of models.
**********************************************************************************************************************************
Dato - software application

Dato GraphLab is a software platform that provides two deep net capabilities (convolutional network and MLP) 
along with machine learning and graph algorithms.

Dato GraphLab - Features

For deep learning model, Dato GraphLab provides convolutional neural network (for image recognition) and MLP (for other kinds of data).
In addition to deep learning nets, this platform also provides machine learning algorithms including text analytics, classification, recommender, regression, and classification.
It provides built-in support for integration of Amazon S3, SQL DB, HDFS, Spark RDD and Pandas data frames.
GraphLab offers UI interface for model management and also includes visualization tool called GraphLap Canvas for visualizing model results.
To work with large data, GraphLab comes with built-in storage support like SFrame, SArray, and SGraph.
Unlike H2O.ai, Graphlab supports the use of GPUs

========================================================
The following are the tools offered by deep net platforms.

Deep Net capability

Deep Net Capability tool, the user can choose among various available deep nets depending on the use case. 
For example, you can select convolutional net for image recognition or RNTN for text analysis and so on

Data Munging

Data Munging tool enables us to import data (structure or unstructured) from various sources and manipulate it 
to feed into a selected deep net.

UI/Model Management

This tool provides a graphical interface to customize deep net, manage deep net models without the need for explicit coding

Infrastructure

In order to train a significant amount of data and increase performance, some platforms provide infrastructure facilities 
like built-in integration tools such as Amazon S3, SQL, and NoSQL
