Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) was conceptualized by Geoff Hinton. It is used in

Dimension Reduction
Regression
Classification


RBMs have two layers:

Input
Hidden

Each input layer is linked to all the hidden layers. Each node in the input layer is not connected to one another.


Learning in RBM

RBMs learn by re-contructing the inputs.
They learn in an unsupervised fashion.
They re-construct the input in a backward manner and update the parameters accordingly.
