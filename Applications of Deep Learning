Image Classification
**************************

Image classification is one of the common applications of deep learning.

A convolutional neural network can be used to recognize images and automatically label them.

************************************
Fact Extraction and Text Translation
************************************

Deep nets can be used to extract facts and relations in the text.

Named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging or sentiment analysis are some of the problems
where neural network models have outperformed traditional approaches.

Texts can be translated from one language to other using RNN. The encoder-decoder recurrent neural network architecture
is the core technology inside Googleâ€™s translate service

*********************
Sentiment Analysis
*********************

Using sentiment analysis, the underlying intent of the text can be extracted.

With social media channels, it is possible to automate and measure what public feels on a given news story, topic, brand or product.

Positive sentiment can be identified thereby allowing the identification of product advocates, 
or to see which parts of a business strategy are working.

**********************
Medical Applications
**********************

Deep nets can be trained to detect cancerous cells and tumors from scanned images.

They are applied in drug discovery by training nets with molecular structure and chemical compositions.

Using MRI and CT scans neural networks can be trained to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors.

*********************
Other Applications
*********************

Deep nets are used in stock predictions and building portfolios and risk allocation.

In digital advertising to optimally bid an ad space in a web page.

In fraud detection to detect suspicious transaction.

Using images from satellites and sensor data deep nets can be trained to detect problematic environmental conditions in agriculture.
