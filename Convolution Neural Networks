Convolution Neural Networks - Yann LeCun


Machines understand images based on the pixel intensity.

So any image in matrix representation will have numbers from 1 to 255.
1 - White
256 - Dark shade of Green


Every image has the same objects represented in slightly different manner.
Each object has to be recognized.
Every feature should be extracted.

How can you identify objects and extract each feature and send it to a neural network for learning?


Convolution layer:
When the image is superimposed with a filter, and run through it once, the output obtained is another image with reduced dimensions. 
This one layer of the filter is called convolution layer.


Pooling:
Pooling reduces the size of an image. Only those pixels that stand out are brought out of pooling



Output Layer:
The Output layer is the last layer where the image is converted into a 1-Dimensional matrix.

Convolutional Neural Network Architecture
******************************************
simple ConvNet is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a ConvNet transforms one volume of activations to another through a 
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build ConvNet architectures: 
Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). 
We will stack these layers to form a full ConvNet architecture


INPUT [32x32x3] will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.

CONV layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as [32x32x12] if we decided to use 12 filters.

RELU(Rectified linear unit)  layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the max(0,x) thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ([32x32x12]).

POOL layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as [16x16x12].

FC (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size [1x1x10], where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, 
    such as among the 10 categories of CIFAR-10. As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume

Imagenet Database
**********************

ImageNet is described as a database of millions of Images scraped from the internet that has been done for "Object Recognition Software Research".

All the images have been annotated by hand.
Every year they conduct a ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) to gauge the accuracy of many software to classify objects correctly.
    
    

Pre-Trained Models

There are multiple pre-trained models available for Image Classification and object detection.

Some of them include

AlexNet
ResNet
VGG19
InceptionResNet
GoogLeNet
DenseNet
NASNet

Some of these models have participated in the ImageNet Challenge in the past   


How do Pre-Trained Models Work?

You can load any of the available pre-trained models and pass a random image. The models will output the probability of each object in that image.
